Within a few days, at the end of May and beginning of June 1940, more than 330,000 British and French troops were evacuated from Northern France. To save them, Allied forces had to sacrifice all equipment and most of their armament. Near Dunkirk, 2,472 guns and about 65,000 vehicles of the British Expeditionary Force and French Army were abandoned. For the evacuation, the British Admiralty called upon over 800 British, French, Dutch and Belgian war and civil ships.\n\nThis included about fifty destroyers, dozens of minesweepers, trawlers, passenger steamships, yachts, fishing boats, salvage and other vessels. One in four vessels was destroyed by the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine attacks, Wehrmacht artillery strikes and mine barriers. Within nine days of the evacuation, 145 British and 156 German aircraft were shot down in battles for air supremacy in the north of France. Winston Churchill said, 'Wars are not won by evacuations.' However, as a result of the Miracle of Dunkirk, the British Army was saved and was able to fight against the Axis powers on new battlefields, and the evacuated French troops formed the basis of the Free French Forces.\n\nFour years later, the Allies returned to France in triumph.

In December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers remained combat-ready in Norway.

The plan called for a fleet centered on six H-39 battleships with 406\u00a0mm main guns and a displacement of 53,000\u00a0tons. In the spring of 1939, two battleships were laid down and the remaining ships were ordered. Work on the ships was then halted due to the outbreak of World War\u00a0II, but the design process continued, and the designers made alterations in response to the changing war conditions.\n\nThe Germans received intelligence reports that the new British Lion-class battleships, which had been under construction since 1939, were equipped with 406\u00a0mm guns. In response to this, in 1942 the Kriegsmarine's Construction Office completed work on the H-41 design with a 420\u00a0mm main battery, reinforced armor, and a displacement of 64,000\u00a0tons. Because of its solid draft, such a warship could no longer be deployed in the shallow waters of the North and the Baltic Seas, but this didn't stop the Germans\u2014they had already conquered the Atlantic coast of France and Norway. Three H-41 battleships were to be laid down 6 to 9\u00a0months after victory on the eastern front. The estimated construction time was five years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reich's High Command requested a larger battleship with no restrictions on its gun caliber or displacement. The Kriegsmarine didn't see any practical need for it but another ministry stepped in\u2014the Ministry for Armaments and Munitions. Reichsminister Speer established the New Ships Construction Commission (Schiffsneubaukommission), a body that was totally independent of the German navy. Between 1942 and 1945, the commission worked out three battleship designs.\n\nThe first design, of the H-42 type, was to carry eight 483\u00a0mm guns placed in four twin-gun turrets and reach a speed of 31\u00a0knots with a displacement of 90,000\u00a0tons. However, there were no slipways large enough to build a ship of that size in Germany, nor anywhere across occupied Europe.\n\nYet the subsequent projects, H-43 and H-44, turned out to be even more colossal. The Construction Office of the Kriegsmarine didn't seriously consider any of the designs elaborated by Speer's Schiffsneubaukommission, and sought to disassociate itself from them. None of the battleships ever made it past the design stage. As a result, it's no surprise that the Third Reich navy documents that ended up in the hands of the Allied intelligence services after the war contain incomplete information about these ships.", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_JAPAN": "Maru 6 Keikaku", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_JAPAN_DESC": "Between 1930 and 1940, the Imperial Japanese Navy consistently pursued a series of Naval Armaments Supplement Programs. One of these programs, dated 1941, provided for the construction of super battleships with 510\u00a0mm guns. The decision to arm them as such was made when a piece of misleading intelligence information came in with a statement made by the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy to the press that the Montana-class battleships ordered in 1940 would carry a 457\u00a0mm main battery and run at 33\u00a0knots. Had that statement been true, those ships would have outmatched the Japanese Yamato-class battleships that were at the core of the Japanese plans to secure a qualitative advantage over the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe project for a new super battleship was indexed \"A-150\". The first design called for eight 510\u00a0mm guns placed in four twin turrets and a displacement of 85,000\u00a0tons. Compared with Yamato, the medium caliber also grew from 155 to 203\u00a0mm, while the 127\u00a0mm AA\u00a0guns were replaced with the latest 100\u00a0mm cannons. But the project turned out to be so enormous and expensive that the Japanese ultimately decided to retrofit Yamato instead. This would save them time as well because replacing 460\u00a0mm triple turrets with 510\u00a0mm twin turrets under an already existing project required much less effort than working out a new one from scratch.\n\nThe second design for an A-150 super battleship was to have a displacement of approximately 70,000\u00a0tons; run at 27\u00a0knots; and carry six 510\u00a0mm main guns plus an AA\u00a0battery comprising 100\u00a0mm guns. No medium caliber guns were to be mounted. One ship was to have been laid down in Yokosuka following the launch of Shinano, and another one in Kure after a fourth Yamato-class battleship had been launched. The ships were to be commissioned between 1946 and 1947, but Project A-150 was destined not to be enshrined in metal and has only remained on paper. As the prospect of war had become increasingly likely by November 1941, the construction of all Japanese battleships was suspended. Permanently, as it turned out.\n\nAmerican intelligence was quite unaware of the work on those projects. Due to the extreme secrecy maintained by Japan in naval construction, the United States didn't even know the main battery caliber of battleships Yamato and Musashi, which were both in service, until the end of the war. They believed that both ships carried only 406\u00a0mm guns. Any encounter at sea between U.S. battleships and these Japanese warships would have entailed dire consequences.\n\nAfter their surrender, the Japanese elaborately destroyed most of the evidence of the A-150 battleship design. For this reason, we have very little information about the last super battleship from the Land of the Rising Sun, and what we do have is extremely contradictory.", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_RUSSIA": "Shipbuilding Decree of 1946\u20131955", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_UNITED_EUROPE": "Marinplan\u00a050", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_UNITED_KINGDOM": "Nine-Year Rule, 1948", "IDS_LEGENDARY_PROGRAM_USA": "Long-Range Shipbuilding\u00a0Plan,\u00a01950", "IDS_LEO_GRADWELL": "Leo Gradwell", "IDS_LEPRECHAUN": "Se\u00e1n McMurphy", "IDS_LEVEL": "Tier", "IDS_LEVELS": "Tiers", "IDS_LEVEL_RESTRICTIONS_FOR_DIVISION_TOOLTIP": "Restriction on the number of ships of this tier in a Division", "IDS_LIBERTY": "Statue of\u00a0Liberty", "IDS_LICENCE_INFO": "Legal information", "IDS_LIGHTDAMAGE": "light damage", "IDS_LIMITED_SHIPS_HEADER": "Restriction by number", "IDS_LIMIT_SIGNALS_COUNTER": "Maximum number of mountable signals", "IDS_LINDWORM": "Lindwurm", "IDS_LINK_FULL_LEGAL_INFO": "Legal documents", "IDS_LINK_MSKIN_UPPER_CASE": "LINK", "IDS_LINK_SUPPORT": "Player Support", "IDS_LINK_SUPPORT_HINT": "You will be redirected to Player Support", "IDS_LOADING": "GAME LOADING\u2026", "IDS_LOADING_PORT": "Port loading", "IDS_LOADING_SCREEN_POWERUPS_HEADER": "Buffs", "IDS_LOADING_TOOLTIP_LEVEL10_0": "Teamwork and mutual assistance will help you survive and win the battle.", "IDS_LOADING_TOOLTIP_LEVEL10_1": "Main battery: double-click [KEY_LEFTMOUSE_DOUBLE] to fire a full salvo from all turrets that are ready to fire.", "IDS_LOADING_TOOLTIP_LEVEL10_10": "To enable autopilot mode, open the Tactical Map by pressing [CMD_TACTICAL_MAP], and then click [KEY_LEFTMOUSE] on the map to set a waypoint.

He was appointed a head of the first Japanese naval aviation school where new aircraft for the Navy were tested.", "IDS_PCQM053_DESCR": "In the late 1920s, Yamamoto was appointed Commander of Akagi, the most powerful aircraft carrier of the Japanese Navy. Due to his extensive knowledge, he participated as Rear and Vice Admiral in two international naval conferences to protect the interests of his country. For a while, Yamamoto commanded the First Carrier Division, then, for a few years, he managed key units of the Navy Ministry, which were responsible for carrier-based aircraft development, and initiated the development of several promising aircraft models. In 1939, Yamamoto left his post of Deputy Navy Minister to become Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the largest naval force of Japan. Though he was against the aggressive intentions of the Army command, which gained a major influence in the country, the Admiral had to prepare the fleet for its upcoming confrontation with the U.S.A. on the Pacific Ocean. Under his command, a famous tactic of the Japanese Navy was honed: attack the enemy at night using the firepower of cruiser squadrons and destroyer-launched torpedoes.", "IDS_PCQM054_DESCR": "Admiral Yamamoto was one of the commanders who foresaw the crucial role of aircraft carriers in the imminent naval hostilities. Though, opposing the necessity of building super battleships, he believed that battleships were the pillars of any naval power. The idea that general engagement of the battle fleet was the only way to gain victory on the ocean battlefront was very popular among the Japanese Navy Commanders after the Battle of Tsushima. Yamamoto, who learned much about the U.S.A. during his service, understood that Japan had a chance to defeat this industrial giant by utilizing surprise air strikes on the U.S.A. ships. That is how the idea to attack Pearl Harbor, the main naval base of the Pacific Fleet, appeared. This attack brilliantly planned by Yamamoto and performed by his pet project, the First Carrier Division, went down in history. The Japanese torpedo bombers and bombers achieved impressive results and repeated the success of Admiral T\u014dg\u014d: seven battleships were disabled, some of them for good.", "IDS_PCQM055_DESCR": "After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto commanded a series of brilliant naval operations and took control of vast territories in the Pacific region. He provided guidance from the most massive Japanese battleships: Nagato, Yamato, and Musashi. His thoroughly planned landing operations included victorious naval battles, in which the forces of the U.S.A., U.K., Australia, and Netherlands were utterly smashed. Progressive tactics and effective use of torpedoes were the strengths of Yamamoto's fleet. Cruiser divisions and destroyer flotillas paved the way, aircraft carriers were the main striking force, and battleships waited for a general engagement. However, Yamamoto's concerns that people, warship, and aircraft losses after a confrontation with the U.S.A. couldn't be compensated, had been justified. The victories were followed by defeats: Midway, Guadalcanal, and many others. In April 1943, Admiral Yamamoto was inspecting the key points on the long frontline. U.S.A. surveillance deciphered information about the flights of the Commander-in-Chief. They organized an extensive operation to intercept the aircraft with Yamamoto on board and managed to shoot it down over the jungles of an island in the Pacific Ocean. The prominent Admiral died clutching his samurai sword.", "IDS_PCQM070_DESCR": "William Frederick Halsey Jr. was a natural-born seaman. He was born in the small port town of Elizabeth, New Jersey, to the family of naval officer. The future Admiral's ancestry included many pirates and whalers, so he was destined to spend his life at sea. In 1899, after failing to obtain a long-awaited appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Halsey Jr. entered the University of Virginia with the single purpose to join the Navy, even as a physician. The only great thing he acquired at university was his passion for American football.\n\nWhen Halsey eventually joined the Naval Academy in 1900, little did they know they had opened its doors to one of its most famous graduates. However, capricious and stubborn \"Pudge\" Halsey was not the sharpest tool in the shed. As far as his academic performance was concerned, he ranked 42nd out of 62 students of the class of 1904. The first ship in his naval career was battleship Missouri. The symbolism of this assignment would only become apparent 40 years later.", "IDS_PCQM071_DESCR": "Commissioned to his first officer rank in 1906, Halsey participated in a legendary cruise of the Great White Fleet\u2014a 1907\u20131909 round-the-world voyage of the 16 advanced U.S. battleships, which was meant to demonstrate the increased naval power of the U.S.A.\u2014aboard battleship Kansas. During the visit to Japan, Halsey had a chance to come aboard Mikasa, the renowned flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet. This glorified battleship didn't impress Halsey... After the cruise ended, the young officer left the ships with big guns for service aboard smaller, faster destroyers.\n\nDuring World War I, Halsey was eventually assigned as a ship commander. The ship was USS Shaw, the Sampson-class destroyer. Once he happened to command a division consisting of two American destroyers and two British sloops, of which he would later recall that he was as \"proud as a dog with two tails\". By the end of the war, Halsey was decorated with a Navy Cross.", "IDS_PCQM072_DESCR": "In the early 1920s, Halsey, who hardly ever disembarked from a ship during his service, was suddenly appointed as a U.S. naval attach\u00e9 in Germany and Scandinavia. In 1930, he commanded a division of destroyers. Then, to pave the way to the rank of admiral, Halsey studied at the U.S. Naval War College for senior officers. In 1935, he was assigned as commander of USS Saratoga, one of the most powerful U.S. Navy aircraft carriers of that time. However, this position required completion of an air observer course. Halsey didn't like this perspective, as he thought it would be much better to control the airplane himself rather than being the \"second person in the cockpit\".\n\nIn 1935, the 52-years-old Halsey completed the full course of a naval pilot, and became the oldest man in the history of the U.S. Navy to earn the Naval Aviator's Wings. Being one of the few at that time, Halsey, same as his future opponent Yamamoto\u00a0Isoroku, became a big advocate for naval aviation, foreseeing that aircraft carriers will be the greatest power in the future war in the ocean.", "IDS_PCQM073_DESCR": "On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Vice Admiral Halsey, who was in charge of the task force headed by USS Enterprise, was far from the Hawaii base, as the storm had delayed their arrival. After learning of the Japanese attack, the admiral, who had an explosive temper, let the hatred for the new enemy grow in his heart. Chester W. Nimitz, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, realized that Halsey's aggression and restlessness was just the right thing for the American seamen depressed by the Pearl Harbor disaster. For this reason, in early 1942, it was Halsey who, with the help of his carrier task force, held a series of\u00a0lightning-like \"hit-and-run\" raids on the Japanese strongholds. After James Doolittle's bombers took off for the Tokyo Raid from the deck of Halsey's aircraft carriers, the name of William Halsey became a personification of the belief in victory over Japan for every American.\n\nIn October of 1942, after taking the command over the South Pacific forces, Halsey led the persistent fight for Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands, that was a key to the entire Pacific Campaign.", "IDS_PCQM074_DESCR": "During the Battle of Guadalcanal, Halsey turned out to be the one the U.S.A. needed the most at that place and time. He fueled confidence in all his subordinates, including each and every seaman or marine, with his overflowing energy and belligerence. He struck blow after blow to the Japanese by sending the advanced battleships and aircraft carriers to the narrow straits of the Solomon Islands, when he thought it was worth it.\n\nWhen, in February 1943, the Americans gained total control over Guadalcanal, Halsey continued the struggle for the remaining islands of the archipelago. He was the first commander in the Pacific theater to apply the strategy of \"island-hopping\" over the most reinforced defensive strong points of the Japanese. \"As\u00a0long\u00a0as I\u00a0have one plane\u00a0and\u00a0one pilot I\u00a0will stay\u00a0on the\u00a0offensive.\" Step-by-step the Admiral was pushing forward, taking risks, making mistakes, and suffering losses, not always justified. The culmination point of the fleet commander's career happened on September 2, 1945. On that day, the\u00a0surrender of the Japanese Empire\u00a0was signed aboard USS Missouri, the flagship of Admiral Halsey, who was the commander of the Third Fleet, the most powerful task force in the U.S. Navy.", "IDS_PCQM091_SHIPS_DESCR": "The 20th century rumbled in under thunders of naval gunfire. The outcome of many a war\u2014the Sino-Japanese War, the Spanish\u2013American War, the Russo-Japanese War\u2014was effectively settled at sea. Based on experience gained in those wars, navies of the world powers developed new technical specifications for the major types of their ships.\n\nIn armored shipbuilding, there was a shift toward battleships with eight to twelve main battery guns of 305\u00a0mm or more in caliber, a new armor protection system, increased speed provided by the adoption of turbines, and improved resistance to flooding. The construction of such ships was a topic of discussion in many countries. England, with its highly developed economy and advanced shipbuilding technologies, took the lead. The Royal Navy's HMS\u00a0Dreadnought was a revolutionary ship that gave its name to the type. All pre-dreadnought battleships abruptly became obsolete, plunging all world powers into a new naval arms race in which only those countries with the mightiest economies could prevail.\n\nIn cruiser building, warships became ever more narrowly specialized, with a large series of high-speed cruisers created specifically for combat operations within squadrons. Speed emerged as one of a warship's primary operational characteristics. To achieve the desired result and maintain an acceptable displacement, cruisers began to switch from coal-fired reciprocating engines to steam turbines and oil burning.\n\nFor destroyers, this process happened even more rapidly. Destroyers were to be agile and fast enough to be able to reach the most advantageous position and moment for an attack. The role of destroyers, according to the experience of past wars at sea, had increased dramatically. Aside from active operations in battles, they carried out their \"routine,\" yet important, duties such as reconnaissance, patrolling, and planting of mines. For that purpose, destroyers began to be equipped with 102\u2013120\u00a0mm guns. The use of fixed underwater torpedo tubes was discontinued in favor of deck-mounted multitube torpedo units placed on a rotating base. Ships were equipped with devices for receiving and planting a large number of mines from the upper deck. All this turned destroyers into a deadly threat for surface ships of all types.\n\nThe chance to test those numerous new features in naval construction came pretty soon\u2014in\u00a01914, World War\u00a0I broke out.", "IDS_PCQM092_SHIPS_DESCR": "During World War I, the evolution of warships of the major types revolved around the simple core idea of making them larger and stronger. The increasingly large caliber of their guns was complemented by their ever-stronger armor protection, which resulted in more significant water displacement and bigger proportions. For battleships, the race was initiated by the British when they designed a series of Queen Elizabeth-class warships with a sharp increase in their main gun caliber (up to 381\u00a0mm). Germany promptly responded with its Bayern-class super-dreadnoughts, which carried the same super-heavy artillery. The German ships, however, outmatched their rivals in terms of armor and combat durability. Their aim was to achieve superiority in quality, as it was impossible to compete with or match the sheer number of ships in the British fleet. Perhaps the only really important novelty in this race for world shipbuilding supremacy emerged when the Americans adopted \"all or nothing\" armor, not typical of warships of the pre-dreadnought era, on their Nevada-class battleships. The new scheme involved heavily armoring the areas most important to a ship, while the remainder received significantly less armor to emphasize protection optimized for long-range engagement. By a twist of fate, the strongest battleships of that period were eventually built by Japan, a country that had, until that time, stayed away from the main theaters of military activity. Hardly any rival ship was on par with their Nagato-class warships in terms of speed, armor and armament combined.\n\nDuring the war, only two European states could afford to build large series of new cruisers\u2014Germany and Great Britain. The trends were the same: when the main caliber of the German cruisers reached 150\u00a0mm, the British designed ships of the Hawkins class with 190\u00a0mm guns, which became the prototype of a totally new subclass of ships\u2014the heavy cruiser. The Americans and Japanese, in turn, carefully considered their military experience in relation to their own objectives. Built to scout for a fleet of U.S. battleships, the Omaha-class light cruisers featured high speed for cooperation with allied destroyers, and 152\u00a0mm guns to fend off any enemy destroyers that might be sent their way. The Japanese, in turn, reinforced their fleet of warships with several series of Kuma- and Nagara-class 5,500-ton light cruisers. Any of the them could be used as both a reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer flotillas during massively overwhelming torpedo attacks.\n\nDestroyers were undoubtedly the most active fighting ships during World War\u00a0I, which is why they would generally be considered the navy's expendable assets. In addition to raiding operations, patrolling and mine laying, this type of ship assumed another military role\u2014anti-submarine warfare\u2014which resulted in corresponding changes being made to their design and armament. The general trend, however, was the same: destroyers received ever more weapons, and the caliber of their guns grew, along with their displacement and speed. During the war, for the first time in the Royal Navy, a new sub-type of ships appeared: destroyer flotilla leaders, the role of which approached light cruisers in terms their characteristics and objectives.\n\nWorld War\u00a0I demonstrated clearly that, during a global conflict, only a few economically powerful countries that had steered clear of direct combat were capable of building the major ship types on a massive scale. But it was clear even to them that the uncontrolled naval arms race was accelerating beyond their capabilities.", "IDS_PCQM093_SHIPS_DESCR": "The economic consequences of World War\u00a0I were so devastating that even the greatest winning states had to commit to something they once thought impossible\u2014conclude a treaty on the limitation of naval armament. From 1922, for the first time in history, naval officials and shipbuilders had to be guided not by operational or strategic considerations, or optimal technical solutions, but primarily by the articles of the Washington Naval Treaty. This treaty contained restrictions on the number, displacement, and armament for the major types of the vessels of war. In addition, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary ceased to rank among the naval powers at that time. It is not surprising, therefore, that the \"Washington Treaty\" period in the history of military shipbuilding turned out to be a rather difficult one.\n\nFirstly, no capital ships were allowed to be built for a period of ten years. At the signing of the treaty, the contracting powers retained their most advanced capital ships in their respective navies. The only exception was the Nelson\u00a0class of British battleships built during that period. To comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with all three main battery turrets carried forward of the ship's bridge, an arrangement unlikely to be used under normal circumstances.\n\nThe Washington Treaty had a more profound effect on cruiser building. Cruisers were limited in terms of quality, but not numbers. Since battleships were no longer allowed to be built, the major naval powers began a competition to build \"treaty cruisers\" using the maximum values for technical specifications allowed by the treaty. To obey the limits on total cruiser displacement established for each navy, designers were forced to make compromises which normally affected armor protection. As a result, during the second half of the 1920s, Great Britain, France, Italy, the U.S.A., and Japan possessed ships boasting a high speed, a 203\u00a0mm main battery, and good seaworthiness, all at the cost of very weak armor. Warships of this new subtype, the need for which was never dictated by any objective naval warfare needs, were collectively known as the \"Washington Treaty Cruisers\".\n\nThe treaty for the limitation of naval armament likewise had an effect on the brand new type of warship\u2014aircraft carriers. In 1922, the number of capital ships employed on fleet duties was sharply reduced. The hulls of the newest battleships and battle cruisers, which were being outfitted at shipyards, could either be scrapped, or converted into aircraft carriers. This way, by the end of the 1920s, the U.S.A., Japan, and Great Britain came to own large, high-speed aircraft carriers that were used to work through basic design solutions and tactics that were later adopted on this type of massively produced, purpose-built ship.\n\nThe trends in the development of destroyers in the post-war years did not change\u2014their size grew, and their armament became deadlier. France and Italy competed in creating ever larger and faster warships, equipped with increasingly more powerful artillery, eventually blurring the line between these ships and light cruisers. During the years of \"forced enthusiasm\" for the construction of \"Washington Treaty\" warships, only a few ships of this subtype were built. However, the real breakthrough came with the appearance of the Japanese destroyers of the Fubuki class and their successors\u2014the Hatsuharu class. Powerful artillery, and most importantly, the crippling long-range 610\u00a0mm torpedoes coupled with a unique system of fast reload right at sea, propelled the destroyer forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy to a leading position in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, as the shock from the world war passed, Germany and the U.S.S.R., the heir to the Russian Empire, again sought to join the ranks of the world's leading powers on land and at sea. For many signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty, naval arms limitations became increasingly difficult to put up with.", "IDS_PCQM094_SHIPS_DESCR": "In the first half of the 1930s, Great Britain went to great lengths to maintain and strengthen the system of international treaties for the limitation of naval armament. Not because Great Britain naturally leaned toward pacifism, but rather because the weakening British Empire could no longer confidently \"hold the trident of Neptune.\" The two conferences that took place in London in\u00a01930 and\u00a01936 modified the terms of the Washington Treaty of\u00a01922 by imposing additional limitations on the size of and armament carried by warships. Apart from that, a number of new limitations were adopted, which would, from then on, be applied to aircraft carriers, destroyers, submarines, and all cruisers.\n\nAll agreements reached earlier lost weight in many respects. Italy refused to sign them, and Japan went as far as to withdraw from the naval treaties entirely. Even attempts to include Germany and the U.S.S.R. in bilateral agreements (based on the Washington/London Treaty system) also failed, despite these countries striving to open an outlet to seas and oceans since the\u00a0mid-1930s.\n\nNevertheless, the London Naval Treaties had a noticeable effect on military shipbuilding. As Japan and Italy refused to join the Treaty of\u00a01936, the United States, France, and Great Britain added an escalator clause to provide for a higher displacement limit to be applied to capital ships allowed for construction. The limit on the caliber of the main battery guns was also increased from 356 to 406\u00a0mm. However, the British designed and laid down their new King George\u00a0V-class battleships with the previous displacement limit and 356\u00a0mm guns. The United States, consistently moving towards the concept of fast battleships, managed to equip their new North Carolina- and South Dakota-class battleships with 406\u00a0mm main battery guns. But the most well-balanced ships of this type, taking into account the treaty limitations, were built in France. Those were the ships of the Richelieu class, equipped with 380\u00a0mm guns\u2014a tit-for-tat response to Italy for building its new Littorio-class battleships. Finally, the second half of the 1930s saw Germany rushing into the select club of owners of full-fledged modern battleships with its excellently protected ships of the Bismarck class.\n\nCruiser building suffered the most from the London Treaties. Subtypes of heavy and light cruisers were identified, and the construction of the former was initially limited and later completely prohibited. This allowed Great Britain to focus on the creation of light cruisers of the new generation with a 152\u00a0mm main battery: the British Empire needed a large number of such ships. However, the appearance of the most powerful Japanese cruisers of the Mogami and Tone class with 155\u00a0mm guns, which, in fact, could easily be replaced with 203\u00a0mm guns, urged the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy to boost the combat capabilities of their light cruisers. Perhaps the most advanced heavy cruiser of the 1930s was the unique French Alg\u00e9rie, while the most protected were the Italian Zara-class heavy cruisers. Among light cruisers, the French ships of the La\u00a0Galissonni\u00e8re class were considered the best in terms of cost and combat efficiency.\n\nAs for the destroyers, in the second half of the 1930s, as well as the powerful Japanese destroyers and fast French flotilla leaders, quite large and well-armed new German destroyers emerged. Due to the existing treaty limitations, the United States and Great Britain responded by creating lighter ships with less remarkable characteristics and armament, but the powerful shipbuilding industry made it possible to build them in incomparably larger numbers.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the treaty limitations were no longer effectively complied with. The great powers were kept from an open, full-scale naval arms race only by the bounds of diplomatic decency and budgetary restrictions of peacetime. However, those bounds were abandoned with World War\u00a0II's outbreak.", "IDS_PCQM095_SHIPS_DESCR": "World War\u00a0II overturned the entire system of limitations on naval armament that existed in the 1920s and\u00a030s, bringing international shipbuilding back to its natural state. From that moment on, every decision was dominated by the need for warships, production capacities, technology, and time. It is not surprising then that the United States was the only country that expressed a wish to build a series of battleships during these years. The Iowa-class battleships fit perfectly into the new format of naval warfare, changing their inherent role from hunting for high-speed Japanese battlecruisers to ensuring the stability of fast aircraft carrier strike formations. It is generally accepted that with all of their performance characteristics combined, they were the best battleships of World War\u00a0II, but this honorary title is contested by the Japanese giants of the Yamato class. In contrast to them, the last battleship of the Royal Navy\u2014Vanguard\u2014looked much weaker, despite her excellent seaworthiness.\n\nA similar situation unfolded during World War\u00a0II in cruiser building. It was possible in this period to create well-balanced and powerful ships, but only the United States and Great Britain had the resources to do so. As a result, the U.S. Navy received a large series of Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, the largest of their type, as well as light cruisers of the Cleveland class. The former ones were the strongest wartime heavy cruisers, balanced so well in terms of armament, armor protection, and seaworthiness that they remained in service for many years. Their enhanced versions served as the basis for the design of the Des Moines-class heavy cruisers equipped with auto-loading main battery guns, and these ships embodied all the experience gained during World War\u00a0II. Armed with 203\u00a0mm main guns and representing the pinnacle of cruiser building under the Washington Naval Treaty, they were the best representatives of the latest generation of heavy artillery ships. In the light cruiser type, they were matched by the ships of the Worcester class, which also entered service after the war and carried a battery of 152\u00a0mm automatic dual-purpose guns.\n\nThe most massively produced surface ships of the World War\u00a0II period were destroyers, as they were involved in all impactful battles in all theaters of military activity. But despite mass production, the loss rate of this type of ship was the highest. Unlike heavy artillery ships, new classes of destroyers entered service during the war, not only in huge series joining the U.S. Navy (Fletcher, Gearing) but also in large numbers in the Royal Navy, as well as in noticeable numbers in Japan (Y\u016bgumo, Akizuki) and Germany (various series of the 1936\u00a0class). After the war, new artillery destroyers were designed by those countries that could not afford to have larger ships in sufficient numbers. Fortunately, in terms of displacement and armament, the destroyers of that time often matched pre-war light cruisers: the Battle and Daring classes of\u00a0Great Britain, the Halland class of\u00a0Sweden, and the Friesland class of the Netherlands.\n\nThe era when steam turbine-driven warships dominated the seas extended over a short period by historical measures\u2014only about half a century, almost coinciding in time with the first half of the 20th\u00a0century.

At the same time, the successful tests of 127 mm dual-purpose twin mounts gave impulse to the Navy command to create a cruiser with such turrets as her main battery.\n\nThe first four ships under this project were laid down in the spring of 1940. The lead ship, USS Atlanta, named after the state capital of Georgia, entered service in late 1941. Despite the impressive number of dual-purpose guns mounted on the cruiser (sixteen), she was not considered an AA defense cruiser and had to fulfil primarily the duties of a scout and destroyer flotilla leader.\n\nHaving arrived at the Pacific Theater of operations, USS Atlanta immediately engaged in active combat activities, taking part in the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and a number of less significant operations. On the night of November 13, 1942, the cruiser was in the epicenter of the battle, known as the Battle of Friday the 13th\u2014one of the most controversial battles in the history of the war in the Pacific Ocean. The American squadron, consisting of five cruisers and eight destroyers, intercepted the Japanese task force (two battleships, a cruiser, and 11 destroyers) sent for the attack on Guadalcanal. The U.S. ships, thanks to their radars, were the first to detect the enemy, but were inexcusably late to open fire. As a result, two columns, American and Japanese, literally collapsed one into the other on a dark tropical night, breaking the formation. In the resulting pileup, where they almost made contact, the sides used not only torpedoes and main battery against each other, but even AA guns. From the very beginning of the battle, Atlanta, furiously shooting in all directions from her rapid-fire mounts, was hit many times, including by one or two torpedoes. For a small, lightly armored cruiser, it was enough, and before the day was over she sank.", "IDS_PCZC183_AA_COLUMBIA": "USS Columbia Fends off the Attacks of Japanese Aviation near the Island of\u00a0Bougainville, 1943", "IDS_PCZC183_AA_COLUMBIA_DESCRIPTION": "When World War\u00a0II broke out in September\u00a01939, all international agreements imposing limits on naval weapons development ceased to exist. As a result, the U.S. Navy Command could replenish their growing fleet with light cruisers without considering their water displacement. However, the world conflict was intensifying, so they had to act quickly:  In order to save the time required to design a project from scratch, the recent \"big\" light cruisers\u2014St.\u00a0Louis and Helena\u2014were used as a basis for the new project.\n\nA requirement to reinforce the ships' AA\u00a0capabilities and the desire to mount advanced gunfire control systems and surveillance radars led to the decision to remove one of the 152\u00a0mm turrets. The resulting light cruiser, armed with twelve 152\u00a0mm guns, was in no way inferior to most ships of her type in terms of main battery firepower and outmatched all of them in terms of AA\u00a0gun strength and an abundance of modern equipment.\n\nThe second ship in the series, USS\u00a0Columbia, named after the state capital of South Carolina, was constructed almost concurrently with the lead ship, USS\u00a0Cleveland, and was commissioned in July\u00a01942.\n\nThe most impressive episode of her combat service was her participation in the Bougainville Campaign (the Solomon Islands) in November\u00a01943. On November\u00a01, four Cleveland-class cruisers, including USS\u00a0Columbia, delivered extremely intense fire with their rapid-firing guns on the enemy positions on the island. Several hours later, during the night battle that later became known as the Battle of\u00a0Empress Augusta Bay, they managed to fend off an attack by a powerful Japanese squadron on the Americans landing place on the Bougainville island without loss.\n\nShortly afterward, in the morning of November\u00a02, USS\u00a0Columbia, together with her three sister ships, repelled a massive enemy air raid during which they shot down more than 20\u00a0aircraft, again without loss.", "IDS_PCZC184_AA_CLEVELAND": "Cleveland-class Cruiser and Independence-class Aircraft Carrier, 1944", "IDS_PCZC184_AA_CLEVELAND_DESCRIPTION": "Cleveland-class cruisers were the world's most numerous series of this type of ship.

After the lead ship, fifteen more vessels were laid down, which made Baltimore-class cruisers the most numerous series of heavy cruisers in the world.\n\nIn their overall layout and silhouette, they resembled their \"light\" Cleveland-class counterparts, and had an equally powerful dual-purpose artillery consisting of twelve 127 mm guns, complementing the main battery\u2014nine 203 mm guns. Seven Baltimore-class cruisers took part in the battles of World War II.\n\nBesides protecting the aircraft carriers with its powerful AA defense, these ships were quite useful in attacking the enemy's onshore positions, both in the Pacific Ocean and during the landing of the Allies in France. Unlike Cleveland-class cruisers, overcharged with weaponry, which prevented their overhaul and predetermined their short life, many Baltimore-class cruisers were reequipped and remained in service until the 1960s and 1970s, having taken part in combat action in Korea and Vietnam.", "IDS_PCZC186_AA_WORCESTER": "USS Worcester after Commissioning, 1949", "IDS_PCZC186_AA_WORCESTER_DESCRIPTION": "Cruiser Worcester, named after a city in the state of Massachusetts, was laid down in January 1945.

Changes were also made during her construction.\n\nWhen the Japanese demonstrated their tactics of kamikaze pilots to the U.S. Navy, the latter decided not to mount 40 mm Bofors guns on new cruisers, but replace them with much more powerful 76 mm AA defense guns instead. Charged with intricate mechanisms, the new twin 152 mm turret proved to be very heavy and bulky. As a result, the \"light\" cruiser, with six such turrets mounted, was comparable in size to her heavy Baltimore-class counterparts.\n\nUSS Worcester and her only sister ship, USS Roanoke, were commissioned only in 1948\u20131949, when World War II was long over. In total, four ships were ordered under the project, but the order for two ships, one of which had been already laid down by that time, was abolished in August 1945, when the victory of the U.S.A. in the war with Japan became a fact.\n\nAfter joining the U.S. Navy, USS Worcester spent most of her service outside the native waters, \"demonstrating her flag\" in the Mediterranean, Latin America, Northern Europe, and the Pacific.\n\nFor participation in the Korean War in 1950\u20131953, the ship was awarded with two battle stars.\n\nIn 1970, already obsolete due to the development of AA defense missiles, USS Worcester was removed from the fleet lists.", "IDS_PCZC187_AA_DES_MOINES": "USS Des Moines during Sea Trials, 1948", "IDS_PCZC187_AA_DES_MOINES_DESCRIPTION": "Night battles, often short, with rapidly changing conditions, forced the U.S. Navy command to create rapid-fire 203 mm guns capable of reigning down the maximum amount of metal and explosives on the enemy in a short period of time.\n\nA triple 203 mm turret with an automatic loading mechanism was created at the end of 1945. As its weight and dimensions significantly exceeded those of similar turrets already used by the Navy and those still to be mounted on heavy cruisers under construction, a new ship had to be designed simultaneously with the new turret.

For example, Soviet heavy cruiser Project 66 was developed with an eye to Des Moines.\n\nWithout a chance to use her main battery against surface targets in the years of active service, Des Moines-class cruisers, as a rule, performed the honorary duties of flagships.\n\nThe firepower of USS Newport News was in demand when attacking onshore targets during the Vietnam War.\n\nTwo out of the three ships of the series were dismantled in the 1990s and 2000s, while USS Salem is still kept as a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts.", "IDS_PCZC188_AA_127MM_MARK5_6": "127 mm Mark 5/6 Gun", "IDS_PCZC188_AA_127MM_MARK5_6_DESCRIPTION": "Five-inch (127 mm) caliber guns were very popular in the U.S. Navy.

Moreover, they were mounted on a number of older ships. For example, in 1904\u20131907, cruiser Albany got ten 127 mm guns instead of her 152 mm and 120 mm guns made in England.\n\nIn the 1910s, the Mark 5/6 was replaced by the 127 mm Mark 7/8 gun which had a higher rate of fire and better penetration capability.

While the casemate-mounted artillery elevation angle was limited to 20 degrees, the maximum elevation angle of the turret barrels was 30 degrees, which ensured a theoretical firing range of more than 23 km.\n\nThe creation of the Mark 16 turret was a milestone in the history of the development of cruiser types. The technological level of the previous, pre-dreadnought era ships did not allow for the creation of sufficiently reliable turret mounts with high-speed gun movement to improve aim at the target. Because of this, in the early 20th century, rapid-fire guns were placed on cruisers, as a rule, right on the deck or in casemates, which limited their firing range and did not ensure their reliable operation in difficult weather conditions.\n\nCommissioning of Omaha-class cruisers in 1923\u20131925 marked a gradual transition to the deployment of all main battery guns on cruisers in turret mounts.", "IDS_PCZC191_AA_152MM_3BARREL": "152 mm Triple Turret", "IDS_PCZC191_AA_152MM_3BARREL_DESCRIPTION": "The main drawback of American 152 mm guns of the 1900s\u20131920s was their relatively small shell weight, 48 kg, whereas almost all similar-caliber artillery systems of other countries used shells heavier than 50 kg.

It was designed for a \"super-heavy\" shell weighing 59 kg, significantly superior to its counterparts in destructive power. A triple turret with a high degree of automation of the loading process was created especially for these guns, which ensured a phenomenal firing rate for those times\u2014up to 10 shots per minute.\n\nSuch main battery mounts were used on Brooklyn- and Helena-class cruisers, and their slightly modified version was deployed on Cleveland- and Fargo-class cruisers. A relatively small initial velocity of heavy shell and close location of the barrels in the turret had an adverse effect on the firing accuracy over long distances. However, the turret's ability to shoot up to 30 shells per minute made it an extremely formidable weapon in close- and medium-ranged battles.

She was commissioned a little more than 12 months later, in June 1917. Valkyrie was the lead ship in a series of flotilla leaders of the V class (5 items). These ships represented a breakthrough for their time, and defined the general appearance of destroyers not only in the British Navy, but also across the other leading navies of the world for a long time to come. Their large dimensions resulted in sea-keeping characteristics and sea endurance good enough to operate conjointly with battle squadrons. Another progressive solution was the placement of artillery guns in super-firing turrets, which later became a standard scheme for subsequent generations of destroyers.\n\nFollowing HMS Valkyrie and her sister ships, several further series of ships were built resembling her, in regard to arrangement and characteristics. From 1917 through 1924, a total of 67 ships were commissioned, collectively designated as V-class and W-class destroyers. Many of them remained in service until 1945, thus participating in World War I as well as being on active duty during the whole of World War II. Initially, HMS Valkyrie was a member of Harwich Force, whose main mission was carrying out escort operations in coastal waters. Later on, she would become a part of the Grand Fleet, the major British naval force.

This ship belonged to the I class\u2014the last series of so-called \"standard\" destroyers. This designation was given to a large group of ships of this type that were built in the U.K. between 1924 and 1938. They shared a \"standard\" arrangement, mainly inherited from the V and W classes, with water displacement of around 1,300 tons, a speed of around 35\u201337 knots, and armament consisting of four 120 mm guns and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Initially, in 1936, the British Navy ordered eight I-class destroyers that were supposed to form one flotilla. It's worth mentioning though that their flotilla leader was built as part of a separate project. Some time later, by the order of the Turkish Navy, four more ships carrying less powerful torpedo armament were built, two of which were inducted into the Royal Navy during World War II.\n\nThe operational record of HMS Icarus was extremely intense. In April 1940, the destroyer took part in the Norwegian Campaign, capturing a German transport ship and playing her role in the Second Battle of Narvik, a glorious event for the Royal Navy. Soon after, HMS Icarus was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. In May 1941, she made an appearance in the well-known Hunt for Bismarck. In the summer of 1944, the destroyer covered the landing operation in Normandy. Besides these roles, throughout the entire war, HMS Icarus participated in a range of convoy operations in the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Region, and Mediterranean during which time she added four sunk German submarines to her combat record.

From 1942 through 1945, a total of 40 ships were laid down, with the construction of two more destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy starting in 1946. At the end of World War II, the Battle-class destroyers were no longer needed in such great numbers, resulting in the completion of only 26 ships of this class.\n\nHMS Jutland and her sister ships conceptually differed from the destroyers of the preceding class in that they were armed with up-to-date and fully-fledged dual-purpose main battery artillery, comprising four or five 113 mm guns. Thanks to the mass production of Bofors and Oerlikon mounts set up in Britain and the U.S., all small-caliber anti-aircraft artillery of Battle-class destroyers consisted of these mounts, which noticeably out-matched the British Pom-Pom's and 12.7 mm machine guns in terms of performance characteristics. However, these ships had just a few occasions to use their powerful AA defenses in practice. Only one destroyer from this series, HMS Barfleur, managed to see action during World War II as a member of the British Pacific Fleet. HMS Jutland did her military service in peacetime and finished it in 1965.", "IDS_PCZC255_HMSDARING": "HMS Daring", "IDS_PCZC255_HMSDARING_DESCRIPTION": "The Royal Navy giving the name Daring to its warships was a tradition dating back to the early 19th century. The sixth ship to bear this name was a destroyer. Laid down in September 1945, HMS Daring and her sister ships were the pinnacle of development of this ship type in Britain, being the largest and most powerful destroyers ever to serve in the navies of the British Commonwealth. Their characteristic feature, in addition to powerful anti-submarine armament, was anti-aircraft artillery whose gun fire control system, together with the main battery's automatic aiming system, which allowed them to simultaneously fire at two targets within the short- and long-range zones of the ship's AA defenses.\n\nThe superiority of the new ships over the other representatives of this ship type was so great that from 1953 to 1957 they were not officially classified as destroyers, but were instead referred to as \"Darings\"\u2014taking the name of the lead ship of the series. Eight ships of this class were inducted into the Royal Navy in the period spanning 1952\u20131954. Later, four more of these ships were laid down for the Royal Australian Navy, but only three of them would be completed.

The new gun had twice the rate of fire and was capable of firing up to 12 shells per minute, with each projectile weighing 22 kg. The elevation angle of the first mounts was 30 degrees, which later was increased to 40, and then further to 55 degrees. The maximum range of fire at the elevation of 30 degrees was about 14.5 km.\n\nMost destroyers built in Britain between 1930 and 1940 were armed with the Mark IX gun model for their main battery artillery. All so-called \"standard\" destroyers starting from the A class, up to the I class, as well as several series of ships of from the time of war, carried four single-mounts each. The J-, K-, N-, and Tribal-class destroyers were equipped with the same guns, but placed in twin-mounts. Fast-firing and quite powerful Mark IX guns were well-suited to hit-and-run battles at short- and mid-range, which is why British sailors valued them so much. The major drawback of this system, that prominently manifested itself in the very first months of World War II, was its inability to effectively fire at airborne targets. The poor ability of the Mark IX to repel the attacks of the Luftwaffe's dive bombers, the nemeses of British destroyers, forced the British Admiralty to focus on the development of dual-purpose guns.", "IDS_PCZC257_40MMPOMPOM": "40 mm AA Pom-Pom Mount", "IDS_PCZC257_40MMPOMPOM_DESCRIPTION": "The best-known British anti-aircraft gun appeared during World War I. It was designed by the Vickers company and went into service from 1915 under the designation \"2-pounder Mark II gun\". The gun was nicknamed the pom-pom because of the characteristic sound it produced when firing. Mark II guns were almost solely produced as single-mounts with manual aiming. Some of the initial pom-pom guns would also be used during World War II, mostly on mobilized civil vessels.\n\nThe early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA gun with a power drive. Due to poor funding, typical of the British Admiralty in the 1920s, the process of accepting the new gun into service was a very long one. Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams. The pom-pom gun was inferior in terms of almost all performance characteristics in comparison to Bofors AA automatic guns of the same caliber. The latter though were under-produced, which is why they never superseded the presence of pom-pom guns on British ships.", "IDS_PCZC258_127MMVIKKERS": "12.7 mm Vickers AA Machine Gun", "IDS_PCZC258_127MMVIKKERS_DESCRIPTION": "The Vickers company developed the 12.7 mm AA machine gun in the mid-1920s. However, it wasn't until 1932 that it entered into service in the Royal Navy. Since the navy did not have any other small caliber AA systems at that time, the Vickers guns became very widespread. In the 1930s and early 1940s, it was present on virtually all ships of the Royal Navy, from battleships to minesweepers.\n\nThe Vickers quadruple mount was the most popular of its kind in the navy. It had to be aimed manually, with a practicable rate of fire of around 150\u2013200 shots per minute, and an effective vertical range of fire a bit higher than 700 m. By the mid-1930s, the 12.7 mm machine gun was considered to be ineffective against up-to-date combat aircraft of that time. However, the British Navy would have no alternative to this weapon until the massive shipments of 20 mm Oerlikon automatic guns commenced.

The elevation angle of its guns, placed in turrets, was 80 degrees, the range of fire at surface targets was 19 km, and the effective vertical range of fire exceeded 12 km. The 25 kg shell of the new 113 mm gun was heavier than the projectile of the \"standard\" 120 mm Mark IX gun. The essential advantages of the new mount were its ability to automatically aim at targets and its mechanized supply of ammunition, which enhanced its rate of fire to 24 shots per minute.\n\nTwo Battle-class destroyers of the Royal Australian Navy, commissioned between 1950 and 1951, were the first to carry these new dual-purpose turrets. The first British ship to receive Mark VI guns as their main battery artillery was HMS Daring, commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952. The last ships of the British Navy armed with these guns were decommissioned in the 1980s.

The next morning, five British destroyers stormed Narvik harbor and, before the enemy knew what was happening, sank two German destroyers and damaged several others. While \"ousting\" the British, who eventually lost two of their ships, the German destroyers exhausted their supply of shells. In addition to their shortage of fuel, they stood no chance of breaking through.\n\nShortly after noon on April 13, an impressive sight could be seen from the snow-covered shores of Ofotfjord: battleship Warspite, accompanied by nine destroyers, including HMS Cossack and HMS Icarus, rumbling with her guns was surfing the mirror-like northern waters.

The allied victory at Dunkirk from the end of May to the beginning of June, 1940, was defined by the 300,000 lives of British and French soldiers that were saved. This operation preserved the lives and freedom of trained military personnel, enabling them to continue their fight in the war. With the cost of the operation being a number of ships and small vessels sunk, the quick decisions made by the navy, improvising at every turn, and the incredible dedication shown by British sailors, soldiers, and civilians, worked miracles in those days.\n\nNearly forty of the Royal Navy destroyers that participated in Operation Dynamo accounted for around a third of all evacuees. Initially, the warships assembled for the operation only intended to cover the boarding of the evacuated soldiers onto civilian ships. However, it would have been nearly impossible to save as many if the original plan was stuck to. So, on the night of May 28, by the light of the fires raging in the city tormented by the Luftwaffe, HMS Wakeful and HMS Gallant were the first to enter Dunkirk's harbor and board soldiers directly from the embankments, while other destroyers joined the evacuation from nearby beaches. On the morning of May 29, during another round of evacuation, Wakeful, loaded with hundreds of soldiers, was sunk by a German submarine.

This convoy would persevere in the history books under the name of Tarigo, after the Italian destroyer that was the escort's flagship.\n\nOn April 15, 1941, British aviation reconnaissance discovered several enemy transport ships heading southward, accompanied by three destroyers. The interception of the convoy from Malta was assigned to Force\u00a0\"K\", which included two J-class and two Tribal-class destroyers. The Force was led by\u00a0Captain (D) Philip Mack, holding his pennant on board HMS Jervis. In the early hours of April 16, British destroyers literally descended upon the unsuspecting convoy, quickly turning the fight into a battle at pistol-shot distance. Three Italian destroyers from the escort resisted the fierce attack, but they could do very little against the twenty-eight 120 mm British guns. At the cost of losing one ship, receiving a torpedo hit at close range, Force K sent the entire convoy\u2014three destroyers and five transport ships\u2014to the bottom of the sea, depriving General Rommel of 1,700 soldiers and several thousand tons of cargo that would have been incredibly valuable to him.", "IDS_PCZC263_HMSMEDEA1916": "HMS Medea in the Dover Patrol, April 1916", "IDS_PCZC263_HMSMEDEA1916_DESCRIPTION": "Destroyer Kriti was built in the U.K. as part of a special project, close to the Admiralty M-class, and joined the Greek Navy in her early days of service.

Medea and her sister ships differed from the other destroyers of the Royal Navy by their original silhouettes with high fore-funnels.\n\nHaving come into operation in May 1915, HMS Medea joined the famous Harwich Striking Force, operating in the waters south of the British Isles. On April 24, 1916, the destroyer took part in an operation to block the\u00a0German Navy's Flanders U-boat flotilla.

The camouflage was applied to the ship's hull by order of her Commander or by the order of the Captain's immediate superiors\u2014Commanders of small units, of destroyer flotillas, etc. The crews used only colors that were immediately available. Clearly, the one most readily available was protective (\"khaki\") or black paint that was applied in spots on top of the standard gray. Such was the pattern of, for example, G-class destroyer HMS Grenade, that was involved in the Dunkirk evacuation.

The goal was not to conceal the ship, which would be quite challenging in regular clashes with the Italians in the open sea, but to disorient the enemy in respect of the perceived distance to target. \n\nThis camouflage pattern, characteristic for destroyers of the Mediterranean fleet in particular, was obtained by applying large broken stripes and black or dark gray spots (MS1, then G5) on the light gray hull of the ship (507c or MS4a, in accordance with the coding of shades adopted by the Admiralty).

These were, as a rule, relatively small but well-armed, high-speed ships, with their main defense consisting of an armored deck with inclined sides. These relatively cheap cruisers were built mostly by order of countries that wanted to have their own navies but were extremely limited in resources.\nIn 1895, Armstrong received an order from Brazil to build three armored cruisers with a displacement of about 3,500 tons, and main armament of rapid-fire 152 mm guns. However, the customer's finances quickly ran low, which resulted in the Brazilian Navy receiving only one ship of this class, named the Almirante Barroso. The lead cruiser of the series was bought by Chile, while the third and the fourth ones \u2013 the latter being ordered by Brazil instead of the lead ship \u2013 were purchased by the United States, a country that could not be said as being limited in funds. The reason behind it was that, in 1898, at the height of the ships' construction, the Spanish-American war broke out, and the United States government feared that the Elswicks would be acquired by Spain, which needed to replenish its fleet with up-to-date combat units. As a result, from 1898\u20131900, USS New Orleans and USS Albany raised star-spangled banners and became the last major ships built abroad to become part of the U.S. Navy.", "IDS_PCZC281_NY2019_VARYAGCARD": "Varyag, 1901", "IDS_PCZC281_NY2019_VARYAGCARD_DESCRIPTION": "On September\u00a024, 1863, the New York estuary welcomed Russian steam corvette Varyag which had arrived all the way from the Baltic Sea.

Their purpose was to create a threat to the ocean shipping lines between England and France, which at that time were quite hostile to Russia. The appearance of the Russian squadrons was perhaps even more valuable for the United States, as the country's position on the world stage at the height of the Civil War was extremely precarious.\nOn May\u00a022, 1899, the ceremonial laying down of armored cruiser Varyag, ordered by the Russian Empire, took place at the William Cramp shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Less than six months later, on October\u00a031, the hull of the ship was launched.

She was a force to be reckoned with: a displacement of nearly 16,000 tons, Krupp cemented armor, improved turret mount mechanisms that provided a rate of fire unrivaled for its time, and fourteen 152 mm guns capable of firing up to seven 45 kg shells per minute.\nFrom the very beginning of her construction, Mikasa was destined to be the flagship of the navy. During her trial period, in early 1902, she received an original paint scheme that, became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy for a short period of time and was not used in any other Navy of the world. In accordance with this scheme, the ship's side, masts, and funnels were covered with black paint, while superstructures, turret mounts, and lifeboats were painted white. The unique detail that made the Navy flagship instantly recognizable was her three white stripes on each of the funnels. However, Mikasa did not pose in her black-and-white dress for too long.

She also had much better armament, with eight 165 mm guns in comparison to the two 165 mm and six 139 mm carried by Ch\u00e2teaurenault and Guichen. Extended trials delayed her commissioning, and, as a result, Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re was completed only in 1903.

In terms of range, speed, and, perhaps most importantly, the reliability of its torpedo weapons, \"Kate\" was noticeably better than its American counterpart\u2014Devastator.\n\nThe \"moment of glory\" for B5N2 was a raid on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The operation involved 144 aircraft of this model, and they acted both as torpedo bombers and as low-level bombers (\"Kate\" could carry up to 800 kg of bombs instead of a torpedo). Every third torpedo launched by the \"Kates\" that day found their target, leaving the U.S. Pacific Fleet with barely any battleships. In 1942, the lethal B5N2 kept on sinking Allied ships one by one in nearly every major battle.

The order to start mass production of the new aircraft, immediately dubbed as the Avenger, followed rather quickly. The plane that came off the assembly lines in the spring of 1942 was large and heavy, but actually this was its main advantage: due to the large volume of its fuel tanks, the aircraft had an unsurpassed action radius. Additionally, its capacious bomb compartment enabled it to carry a 570 mm torpedo or over 900 kg of bombs. Moreover, the torpedo bomber was armed with four machine guns, and the seats for its three crew members were well protected by armor. A powerful 1,900 hp engine ensured that this heavy load reached its destination, and at an excellent speed.\n\nSince August 1942, each and every large-scale operation in the Pacific Theater involved Avengers. From autumn of the same year, they took part in the battle for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean as well. Their service record included the landings in North Africa, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the sinking of battleship Yamato, and the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Avengers acted both as air-to-water bombers and attack aircraft, as well as strike aircraft raiding enemy onshore positions. Equipped with radar, they proved to be wonderful reconnaissance and anti-submarine defense planes, having sunk dozens of submarines.\n\nTheir load capacity, range, and potential for refurbishment ensured that the Avengers had a long career in the armed forces of seven countries of the world. Interestingly, in 1954, they became the first aircraft to enter service in the revived Japanese Naval Forces.

The new aircraft differed from the ground-launched dive bomber with its folding wings, a landing hook, and additional equipment that allowed the plane to be set on a catapult. Since the landing gear of Ju-87 was not retracted, the deck version had a mechanism that could \"eject\" the landing gear in case of ditching. The dive bomber's armament consisted of three small-caliber machine guns and up to 700 kg of bomb load.\n\nThe pre-production of Ju-87C began in the summer of 1939.

The biplane had rather modest speed characteristics, but at the same time it had a sufficiently large action radius and could carry more than 750 kg of weapons payload.\n\nThe Royal Navy actively engaged Swordfishes in the initial period of World War II, despite its extremely archaic design. But this impudence (very British, wouldn't you say?) turned out to be impressively beneficial. On November 12, 1940, in the still of the night, twelve Swordfishes attacked the Italian Navy base in Taranto, wrecking three battleships while losing only two aircraft. With this victory, the British torpedo bombers both changed the course of the war in the Mediterranean and made a strong statement that naval aviation had become an important strategic weapon. In May 1941, a torpedo dropped by a Swordfish made the famous Bismarck face her doom. Subsequently, this easy-to-pilot biplane, with its modest takeoff and landing condition requirements, took its well-deserved place on the decks of the small escort aircraft carriers that accompanied convoys in the Atlantic and Arctic.

It could also claim victories in the air as well. For example, the first British aircraft to shoot down an enemy aircraft was a Skua attached to the 803rd squadron of the Naval Air Force based on aircraft carrier Ark Royal.

To provide the pilot with a good overview during takeoff and landing, the plane had a peculiar hump-shaped silhouette. Another feature of the design of a promising strike torpedo bomber, entitled Wyvern, were two four-blade propellers with opposite rotation.\n\nOrdinary piston engines couldn't provide the required speed characteristics for a well-armed, long-range aircraft capable of carrying a significant load, so Westland's designers chose a turbo-prop engine.

As a result, when the production of the aircraft, named \"Barracuda\", finally commenced in 1942, its characteristics were far from impressive. The Barracuda II, which began to enter service in the Naval Air Force in early 1943, was slightly better with a more powerful 1,600 hp engine.\n\nThe not-too-fast and not-very-maneuverable Barracuda didn't make for a good torpedo bomber. But a number of constructive advantages allowed it to cope well with the role of a dive bomber. The most striking moment of its career was during operation Tungsten, which involved striking battleship Tirpitz, hiding in one of the Norwegian fjords. On April 4, 1944, forty-two Barracudas, coming in two waves, hit the battleship 14 times with their bombs, losing only three planes in the assault. The battleship was put out of action for several months. As the Air Force was obtaining American Grumman Avengers\u2014which surpassed the Barracudas in all respects\u2014as part of a lend-lease, the British aircraft became auxiliary planes, focusing mainly on reconnaissance, the mining of enemy harbors and fairways, anti-submarine patrols, and transporting.", "IDS_PCZC292_BRITISHCVARC_HOOK": "Hook Not Down!", "IDS_PCZC292_BRITISHCVARC_HOOK_DESCRIPTION": "Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) appeared onboard U.S. Navy and Royal Navy aircraft carriers in the 1920s.

On December 30, 1937, the Navy got out of control of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and formed a separate military service called the People's Commissariat for the U.S.S.R. Navy. The first professional officer appointed to the position of the service's People's Commissar (\"Narodny Kommissar\" in Russian) was Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, Flagman Flota 2 Ranga (Flag Officer 2nd rank).\n\nLike any senior military officer, the People's Commissar for the Navy was supposed to establish the official flag. Such a flag was hoisted atop the mast of a ship or other water craft with the People's Commissar aboard. The flag was a red cloth with the Naval Flag of the U.S.S.R. in its upper corner close to the pole and a red star placed in yellow laurel wreath with a ribbon. This flag was used all the time as long as the position of the People's Commissar remained in use.

The highest rank in the naval hierarchy was Admiral Flota, but at that time, no one was considered worthy of the title.\n\nIt wasn't until May 1944 that the People's Commissar for the Navy, Kuznetsov, and his deputy, Admiral Isakov, were the first to be awarded the rank of the Admiral Flota (Admiral of the Fleet). It was around that time that the corresponding insignias were developed. As the decree of 1940 implied the correspondence of the Admiral Flota rank to the Army General of the Land Forces, four stars were placed on the Admiral Flota shoulder boards of 1944 by analogy with the army ranks. In May 1945, a special decree equated the ranks of the Admiral Flota to the Marshal of the Soviet Union.

Kontr-Admiral Rall, Chief of Staff of the Baltic Navy, requested the higher authorities to produce a more reliable pistol at one of the Leningrad plants to arm the naval officers.\n\nAfter considering the issue, the Leningrad Regional Committee of the Communist Party appointed Plant No. 181 to design and manufacture the first batch of new pistols as soon as possible. Having received just drawings of the parts in January 1942, the masters at the plant made a prototype by hand. In March 1942, it was successfully tested at the temperature of \u221230 degrees Celsius. The pistol, named Baltiets in honor of the Baltic Navy, had a 7.62 mm caliber and a magazine for eight cartridges. Under the blockade, a total of 14 Baltiets pistols were made by hand.

Impressed by the crew's training level and the ship's excellent condition, he presented the cruiser Commander with the GAZ-A.\n\nGAZ-A was the first Soviet passenger car of mass production. It was produced between 1932 and 1936 and was a licensed copy of the American Ford Model A, as it was impossible for the Soviet industry of the early 1930s to assimilate the production of an original model.

Initially, the armament of the designed battleship was supposed to be placed in double-gun turrets, but the Naval General Staff insisted on installation in triple turrets.\n\nThe new 305 mm, 52 caliber gun was designed at the Obukhov Plant in St. Petersburg. The first copy was made in 1907. The three-gun turret was developed at the Metal Plant in St. Petersburg. The turrets of the Baltic battleships (Sevastopol, Gangut, and others) were protected by 203 mm thick armored plates. The maximum gun elevation angle was 25 degrees, which provided a 24 km range of fire of the 1911 shell.

It was obvious that other countries would soon follow the example of the British and increase the caliber of their new dreadnoughts. In this regard, the Russian Naval Services decided to make 356 mm guns the main weapon of future ships.\n\nIt is quite natural that the guns and turrets for the battleships were designed on the basis of the Gangut/Sevastopol-type guns and turrets that had already been put into production. Being very powerful for their time, the 356 mm, 52 caliber guns, developed in 1913 at the Obukhov Plant, were able to fire 748 kg shells at a range of more than 23 km at a maximum turret elevation angle of 25 degrees, according to the project. In 1914, World War I was the reason the Empire's industry diverted to the more pressing issues. As a result, work on neither the battleships nor the turrets was ever completed.

They were also supposed to have 406 mm guns, but the best practices from 20 years ago were no longer suitable. Between 1937 and 1940, the 50 caliber B-37 gun was designed and manufactured at the Bolshevik Plant in Leningrad.\n\nThe range tests of the B-37 guns were carried out in the second half of 1940. The firing velocity of a 1,108 kg shell was 830 m/s. The firing range at an optimum elevation angle of 45 degrees exceeded 45.5 km. The B-37 guns were the main weapons of the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Triple turrets were designed at the Leningrad Metal Plant, which once developed turrets for the first Russian dreadnoughts.

Having studied the characteristics of possible enemy ships, a special commission assembled by the Navy Chief Command came to the conclusion that Soviet ships must be armed with 457 mm guns in order to fight successfully against the most powerful of them (e.g., American Iowa-class battleships).\n\nDespite outstanding combat data (with a range of fire of up to 52 km), calculations for a triple 457 mm turret made in 1949 showed that such mounts would have substantial mass and size drawbacks. Such turrets would be almost twice as heavy as those of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships, and the draught and cost of Project 24 ships would be beyond the reach of Soviet industry.

However, in early December 1790, General Alexander Suvorov joined the command of the besiegers, and the fate of Izmail was decided. \"I came here with the troops. Twenty-four hours for reflection, and you will be given freedom. My first shot will mean your captivity. When we assault, only death awaits you\". This was Suvorov's ultimatum to the Turks. On December 11, 1790, after a violent assault, Izmail fell. Its first commandant was General Mikhail Kutuzov, who distinguished himself during the capture of the fortress and who would later defeat Napoleon in the war of 1812.\n\nInspired by its success, Catherine the Great awarded all the soldiers, cossacks and sailors who participated in the siege, a silver service medal.

One of the heroes of the victorious Battle of Vittorio Veneto who did not suffer a single serious defeat, Emanuele Filiberto was nicknamed \"Invincible Duke\" (Italian: \"Duca Invitto\"). The motto of the cruiser named after him was the Latin dictum \"Victory gives us life\".

However, a number of cities and regions with a predominantly Italian population continued to remain as part of Austria-Hungary. Among them was the city of Trento, one of the centers of the movement for unification with Italy, which only occurred in 1919 following the results of World War I.\n\nSuch a significant event had to be reflected in the naming of the Italian Royal Navy ships: the first in a series of cruisers to be laid down after the war ended was named Trento. The ship entered service in 1929 as a conventional \"Washington Treaty\" cruiser\u2014a fast warship with powerful artillery but poor armor protection. Trento saw extensive action in the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea during many World War II encounters.

The transition of the city in 1918, under the rule of the Italian Crown, was of great importance for the development of the Regia Marina. The very first warship laid down after the war at the shipyard in Trieste\u2014a 10,000-ton cruiser with 203 mm main battery guns\u2014was named Trieste.\n\nThe commemorative medal minted for those who served on this ship depicts a symbolic image of the city of Tergestum, the earliest recorded mention of which was attributed to Julius Caesar, as well as the cruiser's motto: \"Brought back liberated\" (Latin: \"Redente redimo\").

After the unification of Italy in 1861, the desire to claim this significant port passed \"by inheritance\" to the Kingdom of Italy. That desire was brought to life only following the results of World War I. By designating the newest heavy cruiser launched in 1930, the lead ship in a series of four, as Zara, the Kingdom of Italy made it clear to the whole world who the city belonged to. The symbol of Venice\u2014the Lion of\u00a0Saint Mark\u2014depicted on a commemorative medal granted to the ship's servicemen, was reminiscent of the times when the city was under Venetian rule. On the same side of the coin the cruiser's motto: \"Persistent\" (Italian: \"Tenacemente\") could be found. \n\nAfter Italy entered World War II in June 1940, cruiser Zara did not even last a year. In March 1941, she was sunk by a British squadron in the Battle of Cape Matapan. In 1947, the city of Zara was handed over to Yugoslavia to be re-named the Croatian way\u2014Zadar\u2014which is when the \"Italian\" page in the city's history came to an end.", "IDS_PCZC400_NY2020_PLANNING": "Design", "IDS_PCZC400_NY2020_PLANNING_DESCRIPTION": "The first stage in the life of any warship is her design.

It sometimes has several versions and is issued by the Naval Authorities. With the most suitable sketches of the new ship's appearance and layout selected, detailed development of the project begins. Depending on any changes to the requirements of the future warship and the feasibility of her construction in the context of the country's available resources, the design stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years. For example, the keel of the U.S. Navy's first \"large cruiser\" was laid down in November 1941, whereas the project's first sketches had appeared back in January 1940.

It was the most reliable method of securing and fastening the structures of a ship\u2019s hull. Riveting remained immensely hard work, even when pneumatic riveting hammers came into use. The thoroughly coordinated work of two people was required for the installation of each rivet, which would be heated up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, and the number of such rivets on a large ship could amount to hundreds of thousands.", "IDS_PCZC405_NY2020_CRANEOPERATOR": "Crane Operator", "IDS_PCZC405_NY2020_CRANEOPERATOR_DESCRIPTION": "Nowadays, the image of a woman driving a heavy vehicle or any industrial machine isn't quite out of the ordinary. However, during World War II, such an image was still considered to be rather odd. Nevertheless, men who had left their jobs at industrial enterprises to join the army were replaced by women in nearly all professions, including, for example, that of a crane operator. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt said that citizens' sacrifices on the home front were no less important for securing victory than the efforts of soldiers serving overseas.

At first, welding was used in the assembly of relatively \"light\" frames of superstructures. Over time, with the development of the technology, welding became more widespread, until ships with fully welded hulls finally appeared. As a result, their weight was decreased by 15\u201320%, and in some cases, even up to 30%.

Because of this, Cap's ship received minimal damage\u2014only a fragment from an HE shell smashed a cage in which five polecats resided.\n\nAfter the war, the British Navy was scaled down, and Cap received an advanced cruiser named Raleigh.

As of 1914, the destroyer had the greatest number of torpedo tubes\u2014five twin torpedo launchers\u2014though their caliber was a bit less than that of British, American, and German destroyers.\n\nArtillery consisting of three 102\u00a0mm guns was comparable to British ships of the same type, but was inferior in terms of caliber to Japanese and Italian ships, and to American ships in their number. But the Russian 102\u00a0mm guns surpassed them in terms of rate of fire, shell weight, and firing range. Finally, Derzki was second to none in terms of mine armament\u2014no other destroyer could carry 80 obstacle mines.\n\nThe ship took an active role in World War\u00a0I in the Black Sea by participating in dozens of operations. During the Civil War, the destroyer was interned, after which she became part of the White fleet.

So, they decided to build a one-of-a-kind cruiser, trying to experiment and create a project based on the latest Brooklyn-class light cruisers and replacing 152\u00a0mm guns with 203\u00a0mm guns.\n\nThe hull inherited from the prototype provided better seaworthiness and resistance to damage in combat. The armor thickness was increased, and, in terms of armor protection, Wichita was superior to all previous American cruisers. The main battery guns were placed in new turret mounts and the anti-aircraft armament, consisting of the latest 127\u00a0mm AA guns, was mounted in a much more rational way.\n\nThe ship entered service in 1939, just before World War\u00a0II began. The outbreak of war in Europe canceled all contracts and allowed the countries to return to the construction of cruisers armed with 203\u00a0mm main battery artillery which had been banned since 1936.

A new 406\u00a0mm main battery gun was specifically developed for the ship, and in\u00a01939, Congress approved the construction of four such battleships at once and two more ships soon afterward.\n\nInitially, the project was conceived as a high-speed variant of the South Dakota-class ships, which had already been laid down, but the hull had to be thoroughly redesigned. In terms of armor and anti-torpedo protection, Iowa was almost similar to her predecessor. The new armament meant her main battery guns turned out to be much more powerful.

Their super-heavy 1,225\u00a0kg Mark\u00a08 AP shells had an effect comparable with the 460\u00a0mm ammunition of battleship Yamato, while being considerably lighter. The matter of choosing the main battery for the fast battleships of the U.S. Navy caused a great many discussions in 1938.\n\nOn one hand, the 406\u00a0mm/45 Mark\u00a06 guns designed in the mid-1930s for the preceding North Carolina and South Dakota-class battleships were already considered to be the most powerful in the world. Compared with other large-caliber guns, they fired very heavy 1,225\u00a0kg shells that had a relatively modest initial velocity of 701 meters per second. The shell trajectory was more of an arcing one, and no armored decks of any existing ships were capable of withstanding these shells when fired from significant ranges. Because of this, there were no specific reasons to replace these guns with something new.\n\nOn the other hand, depots in the U.S. stored over one hundred of the 406\u00a0mm/50 Mark\u00a02 guns that had been produced throughout 1918\u20131922 for battleships that went unfinished due to the Washington Treaty on the limitation of naval armament. Owing to a longer barrel length, they possessed very high muzzle energy. This enabled an increase in armor penetration and firing range for the main guns of new ships with small material inputs. Lastly, the Naval Bureau of Ordnance proactively worked on the development of new 406\u00a0mm/50 guns that were lighter and more modern. This last factor resolved the issue: according to the estimates, the Mark\u00a02 gun was significantly heavier than the Mark\u00a06 and it required a bigger turret for mounting.

The lead ship was also the first of its kind. On February 13, 1915, V-25 hit a mine in the North Sea and sank. Franz Wieting outlived his ship. During the war, he commanded a destroyer flotilla. In the Reichsmarine, he was promoted to rear admiral, then led the German Navy in the North and Baltic seas. He retired in 1927, but returned at the beginning of World War II and served on land between 1939 and 1942.

They were truly versatile in terms of their AA defenses, ASW, and mine defenses. They were distinctive for their seaworthiness and maneuverability, and became the most-used large German combat ships of the end-war period. The average length of service of fleet destroyers was just 13 months. Out of 15 ships that entered service between 1942 and 1944, 11 were destroyed.\n\nThe lead T-22 Flottentorpedoboote joined the Kriegsmarine on February 28, 1942, and soon after that, headed to the Bay of Biscay. She participated in fierce battles against the British forces that attacked German submarines and blockade runners as they entered the Atlantic. In June 1943, Captain Lieutenant Hans Bl\u00f6se took command of the ship. He spent the entire war on the bridges of destroyers. As commander of T-22, he proved himself in victorious battles in the English Channel. He also managed to survive the German defeat in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe ship was quite lucky with Bl\u00f6se\u2014in January 1944, T-22 sailed to the Baltic and escaped destruction, unlike the same-class destroyers in the west that were sunk in the spring of the same year. But the commander was replaced in April, and lady luck abandoned the ship with him. Overnight, on August 18, 1944, T-22 was destroyed by mines in Narva Bay, together with other two Flottentorpedoboote.

It was decided to develop the previously successful 1936 Roeder-class project. The primary distinction of the new eight 1936A Narvik-class ships was the transition to more powerful 150 mm main battery guns. But the size of \"Narviks\" was too small for this armament and didn't allow for the realization of its benefits, and at the same time, their seaworthiness was sacrificed. In later projects, the Germans returned to installing 127 mm main battery guns on destroyers.\n\nThe 1936A-class Z-23 lead ship joined the fleet on September 14, 1940. For her first year and a half of service, the bridge was occupied by Fregattenkapitan Friedrich B\u00f6hme (1899\u20131984), who had previously been commander on destroyer Anton Schmitt and was decorated with the Iron Cross, 1st Class, for the Battle of Narvik. Z-23 always escorted large raiders, including Bismarck, out into the ocean. She also actively operated in the Soviet Arctic and Norway. In May 1942, B\u00f6hme was transferred to a command position on land. During 1944 and 1945, he led submarine saboteur units in Normandy and Italy, and earned the Knight's Cross. From the spring of 1943, his former ship participated in battles in the Bay of Biscay until August 12, 1944, when British bombers dealt devastating damage to her in the La Pallice seaport.", "IDS_PCZC552_GERDD_1004_BATGE": "Z-35 and\u00a0Niels B\u00e4tge, 1943\u201344", "IDS_PCZC552_GERDD_1004_BATGE_DESCRIPTION": "Z-35 was unlucky from the start. In 1939, she was one of nine destroyers of the new 1938B-class, but the Kriegsmarine abandoned the project due to it being inferior to the same-type ships of the enemy. Z-35 was ordered again based on the pre-existing Project 1936A. The start of construction was shifted and the ship was laid down only in the middle of 1941. Soon after, based on the operational experience of such destroyers, it was decided to stop using 150 mm main battery guns and bring back the time-tested 127 mm ones. Their AA defenses, as well as their radio and electronic equipment, were also improved. The ship's construction process continued from the middle of 1942, using the reworked 1936B project as the basis. Z-35 was brought into service only on September 22, 1943. She was the first of three destroyers of her class.\n\nCorvette Captain Niels B\u00e4tge (1913\u20131944) became the ship's commander. A holder of the Knight's Cross, he successfully led a flotilla of torpedo boats in the English Channel between 1940 and 1943. Z-35 was his first large ship, and it was also his last. Between February and December 1944, the destroyer operated near the Baltic shores as part of the Kriegsmarine force tasked with preventing the Soviet forces from advancing. At first, the ship was even based in Tallinn\u2014B\u00e4tge's hometown.

On their last voyages to Scandinavia and the Baltic before the shipping routes froze over, Dutch merchant sailboats would tie a fir tree to their masts. This served as a signal to let Dutch folks staying in overseas ports for the winter know that they could leave letters and parcels on board for delivery home. Even when a regular mail service was established, that tradition didn't wane. The people of Groningen cherished the tradition so much that when the same-name destroyer was decommissioned in 1981, they asked the naval authorities to temporarily assign another ship to carry a Christmas tree. That honor was granted to the frigate Kortenaer.
